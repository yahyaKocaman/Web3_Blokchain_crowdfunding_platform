## Description

The Crowdfunding Platform is a decentralized application built on the Stellar Blockchain, enabling users to create and fund various projects. 
Users can easily launch their projects by providing details and funding goals. 
Supporters can browse projects and contribute funds, helping bring innovative ideas to life.

Key features include:

- **Project Creation:** Users can create projects with clear descriptions, funding goals, and timelines.
- **Project Funding:** Supporters can directly fund projects using Stellar's fast and secure transaction capabilities.
- **Automatic Fund Transfer:** Once a project's funding target is reached, funds are automatically transferred to the project creator, ensuring a smooth process.

This platform aims to empower entrepreneurs and creators by connecting them with potential supporters, making it easier to turn dreams into reality.

## Vision

The Crowdfunding Platform envisions a vibrant ecosystem where entrepreneurs and creators can transform their ideas into reality. 
By providing a space for users to create and support projects, we empower individuals to pursue their passions and make a positive impact on their communities. 
Our platform fosters collaboration and connection, allowing users to contribute to meaningful goals set by fellow community members. 
We believe that through collective effort and support, we can unlock the potential of innovative ideas, driving social and economic growth while inspiring others to dream big and take action.

## Project RoadMap / Future Plans

### Software Development Plan for Crowdfunding Platform

**1. Define Smart Contract Specifications**  
   - Identify key features and functionalities for the smart contract, including:
     - **Variables:**
       - Project ID
       - Project creator address
       - Funding goal
       - Current funds raised
       - Project deadline
       - Status (active, completed, or failed)
     - **Functions:**
       - `createProject()`: Allows users to create a new project.
       - `fundProject()`: Enables users to contribute funds to a project.
       - `checkFundingStatus()`: Returns the current funding amount and status.
       - `completeProject()`: Automatically transfers funds to the creator if the goal is met.
       - `refund()`: Allows refunds if the funding goal is not reached by the deadline.

**2. Develop Smart Contracts**  
   - Implement the smart contract using Rust for the Stellar blockchain, incorporating the defined functions and variables.  
   - Write unit tests to ensure the contract works as expected.

**3. Build the Front-End Interface**  
   - Create a user-friendly interface using a framework like React or Angular.  
   - Features to include:
     - Project creation form
     - Project listing page
     - Funding interface with contribution options
     - Dashboard for project creators to track funding progress

**4. Integrate Smart Contracts with Front-End**  
   - Connect the front-end application to the smart contracts on the Stellar blockchain using appropriate libraries (e.g., Stellar SDK).  
   - Ensure smooth communication between the UI and the blockchain for creating and funding projects.

**5. Test the Entire System**  
   - Conduct thorough testing of the complete application, including smart contracts and front-end integration.  
   - Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.

**6. Deployment**  
   - Deploy the smart contracts on the Stellar testnet for further testing.  
   - Launch the front-end application, ensuring proper hosting and access for users to start creating and funding projects.
